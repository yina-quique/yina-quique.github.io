Below, you will find a link to access a repository of sentences in Spanish designed by people with aphasia, caregivers, and clinicians working with this population. The repository is completely **free**.

https://yina-quique.github.io/repositorio/ 

The sentences can be **used by Spanish-speaking people with aphasia who want to learn sentences from everyday life.** The sentences are designed to be learned using software called Anki.

This repository was designed as part of a project funded by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) Switzer Research Fellowship Program.
