I am\nespecially interested in developing culturally-sensitive and\nlanguage-specific interventions for Spanish speakers with aphasia.\nOutside of my work life, I enjoy coffee dates with my husband. I also\nlove reading children’s books to my niece and nephew.\n\n\nTwitter \nGithub \nEmail \nORCID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy research path\nI was trained as a Speech and Language Pathologist in Colombia, where\nI practiced for more than seven years. During that time, it gradually\nbecame evident that aphasia assessments and treatments were not designed\nfor Spanish-speaking individuals and that a direct translation from\nEnglish resources did not fully meet the needs of my patients. Moreover,\nover 85% of published aphasia treatment research has focused on English,\nleaving a need to advance aphasia research and evidence-based service\ndelivery in other languages and cultures. To address this disparity, my\nresearch program has included:\na doctoral training that allowed me to help improving aphasia\nrehabilitation for Spanish speakers by adapting assessments and a\ngold-standard aphasia treatment –script training– for Colombian people\nwith aphasia.\nAn international aphasia research network, the Collaboration of\nAphasia Trialists –CATs, where I work to adapt assessments for\nlinguistically diverse populations. CATs has also helped me to foster\ninternational collaborations between educational, research, and\nhealthcare institutions, preparing me to contribute to positive\nreal-world changes in service delivery and outcomes for people with\naphasia.\nA theoretical-driven approach to understanding the mechanisms of\naphasia treatment response combined with advanced statistical\nmethodologies.\nFor my postdoctoral training, I’m strengthening my aphasia\nrehabilitation training by working with Dr. Leora Cherney at Shirley\nRyan Ability Lab. I’m also combining it with practical training in\nhealthcare service delivery and outcomes research at the Center for\nEducation in Health Sciences at Northwestern University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
